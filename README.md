## Immunization Logistic Regression

### Contents
1. **immune_lr.ipynb**:  Python notebook containing data cleaning/preprocessing/modeling
2. **immune_data.csv**: Csv file used to create model. 1085 records
3. **pneumo.csv**: immunization probabilities for Pneumococcal vaccine 3/16-3/17
4. **tdap.csv**: immunization probabilities for tdap vaccine 3/16-3/17
5. **metrics**: output of training and testing performance for both pneumo and tdap models

### Methodology
The vaccination probabilities found in each table was created by concatenating both training and testing results from each respective logistic regression model (1 model for predicting tdap vaccine 3/16-317, 1 model for predicting pneumo vaccine 3/16-3/17
